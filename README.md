# Vaadin and Selenium
The lack of technical support is a popular excuse to not have to test UIs. The fact that this excuse no longer counts, the current section of the column "Backend meets Frontend" shows how developers with Vaadin and Selenium can lay the foundations for a test-driven development.

## How to start
Here you can see a minimal Version of, howto start with Selenium tests.

Under _data/ you can find a few binaries with WebDriver for Chrome.
This I used for my example, but it is not needed to use exactly this one.

The example will try to read the binary file from _data/chromedriver
to load the Driver binary. Check the website from Selenium, 
how to install it if you donÂ´ want to use this local one.

You need an installed Chrome on your machine to run the tests.

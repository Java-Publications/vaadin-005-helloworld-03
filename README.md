# Vaadin and Selenium

Here you can see a minimal Version of, howto start with Selenium tests.

Under _data/ you can find a few binaries with WebDriver for Chrome.
This I used for my example, but it is not needed to use exactly this one.

The example will try to read the binary file from _data/chromedriver
to load the Driver binary. Check the website from Selenium, 
how to install it if you donÂ´ want to use this local one.

You need an installed Chrome on your machine to run the tests.
